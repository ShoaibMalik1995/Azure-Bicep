# Azure Bicep - Troubleshooting Bicep Errors

## Overview
This section explains how to troubleshoot error messages in Bicep. Bicep is a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) for deploying Azure resources, and like any deployment tool, you may encounter errors that need to be resolved.

## Troubleshooting Steps
- **Method 1: Using the Terminal Window**
Deploy the Bicep File:
When you deploy your Bicep file using the terminal, any errors will be displayed directly in the terminal window.

Read the Error Message:
If the deployment fails, an error message will appear in the terminal. This message usually provides details about what went wrong.

Analyze the Exception:
Go through the exception details to understand the exact error. The terminal will often provide a stack trace or a specific message indicating the issue.

- **Method 2: Using the Azure Portal**
Navigate to the Azure Portal:
Log in to the Azure Portal.

Go to Resource Group:
Select the resource group where your deployment was attempted.

Access Deployment Settings:
In the resource group, navigate to Settings -> Deployments.

Locate the Failed Deployment:
Under Deployments, find the deployment with a Failed status.

View Error Details:
Click on the failed deployment. In the status column next to the failed status, click on Error details. This will provide a detailed message about the failure.

Example
Here is an example of how to use the methods described above:

ERROR: Deployment failed. Correlation ID: <correlation-id>. {
  "error": {
    "code": "DeploymentFailed",
    "message": "At least one resource deployment operation failed. Please list deployment operations for details.",
    "details": [
      {
        "code": "BadRequest",
        "message": "The provided database 'myDatabase' has an invalid configuration."
      }
    ]
  }
}

## Best Practices
- **Read the Error Messages Carefully**: Both in the terminal and the Azure Portal, error messages provide valuable information for diagnosing issues.
- **Check Logs and Documentation**: Azure and Bicep documentation can offer insights and solutions to common problems.
- **Validate Bicep Files**: Use the Bicep CLI to validate your files before deploying: bicep build <file>.bicep.

By following these steps, you should be able to diagnose and fix most issues encountered when deploying with Bicep.
