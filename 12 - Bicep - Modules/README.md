# Azure Bicep - Modules

## Overview
This repository contains a Bicep module designed to simplify the deployment and management of Azure resources. Bicep is a domain-specific language (DSL) for deploying Azure resources declaratively. It provides a more concise syntax compared to traditional ARM templates, making it easier to author and maintain infrastructure as code.

## Features
- **Modular Design**: Create reusable Bicep modules for different resources.
- **Parameterization**: Pass parameter values from the main Bicep file to modules, avoiding hardcoding.
- **Reusability**: Use the same Bicep scripts for different deployments by adjusting parameters.
- **Simplified Management**: Manage your Azure infrastructure efficiently with Bicep's concise syntax.
