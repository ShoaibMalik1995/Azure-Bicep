# Azure Bicep - Design Pattern 2 - Shared Variable File

## Overview
This document explains the Azure Bicep Design Pattern 2: Shared Variable File. This design pattern is one of the four recommended by Microsoft to enhance the efficiency and maintainability of your Bicep templates. The Shared Variable File pattern allows for the centralization of variables, which can then be reused across multiple Bicep files, promoting consistency and reducing duplication.

## Benefits of Using a Shared Variable File
- **Centralized Management**: Manage variables in one location, making it easier to update and maintain.
- **Consistency**: Ensure consistent values across multiple Bicep files, reducing the risk of discrepancies.
- **Reusability**: Reuse common variables across different Bicep templates, reducing redundancy.

## Best Practices
- **Consistent Naming**: Use clear and consistent names for your variables to ensure clarity and ease of use.
- **Documentation**: Document the purpose and usage of each variable within the shared variable file to facilitate understanding and collaboration.
- **Environment-Specific Variables**: Create separate shared variable files for different environments (e.g., sharedVariables.dev.bicep, sharedVariables.prod.bicep) to manage environment-specific configurations easily.
- **Version Control**: Store your shared variable files in version control to track changes and collaborate with your team effectively.

## Conclusion
The Shared Variable File design pattern in Azure Bicep promotes efficient and maintainable infrastructure as code by centralizing variable management. By adopting this pattern, you can ensure consistency, reduce redundancy, and streamline the deployment process across your Azure environments.
