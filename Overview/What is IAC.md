# What is IAC?

- IAC stands for Infrastructure as Code
- The provisioning and management of Infrastructure is done via Code
- You can maintain the IAC in version Control systems like Git in the same way developers maintain the source code

# Popular IAC tools
- ARM Templates
- Terraform
- Bicep

# What is Bicep?
- Bicep is DSL (Domain Specific Language) for provisioning the Azure Resources declaratively
- It's a wrapper to ARM Templates
- Bicep is converted (Transpiled) into ARM templates and then submitted to ARM Engine
- Bicep code is Simple, Human readable and crisp than ARM Templates
- Anything that is done with ARM can be done even with Bicep

Here is the URL for the Bicep playground, where you can play with Bicep and see the corresponding ARM template code.
