# Azure Bicep - Azure Serverless Functions

## Overview
This guide provides an overview of deploying serverless functions using Azure Bicep. Serverless functions in Azure are powered by Azure Functions, which allow you to run code without provisioning or managing servers. With Bicep, you can define and manage these functions as part of your infrastructure-as-code (IaC) strategy.

Azure Functions provide a serverless compute experience where you can run event-driven code without having to explicitly provision or manage infrastructure. Using Azure Bicep, you can define, deploy, and manage these functions declaratively, ensuring consistency and repeatability across your deployments.

## Prerequisites
Before you start, ensure you have the following:

- Azure subscription
- Azure CLI installed
- Visual Studio Code with Bicep extension installed
- Basic understanding of Azure Bicep and Azure Functions

# Architecture Overview
The architecture comprises three main components: the Azure Function App, Storage Account, and Application Insights. Each of these components plays a crucial role in the overall functionality and monitoring of your serverless solution.

## Azure Function App
- **Purpose**: The Azure Function App serves as a container for serverless functions. It provides a scalable, event-driven compute service where you can execute your code without provisioning or managing servers.

- **Details**:
 - Within a Function App, you can deploy one or more functions. Each function is designed to respond to specific events or triggers, such as HTTP requests, timers, or messages from a queue.
 - The Function App ensures that all the functions within it share the same settings, resources, and configuration, making it easier to manage and scale your serverless applications.

## Storage Account
- **Purpose**: The Storage Account is mandatory for the Function App to operate. It provides the necessary storage for managing the state and execution of your serverless functions.

- **Details**:
 - The Storage Account handles triggers and bindings for the functions. For example, if you have a function triggered by a new blob in a storage container, the Storage Account manages this event.
 - It stores logs, metadata, and other essential data required for the Function App's operation.

## Application Insights
- **Purpose**: Application Insights is an optional but highly recommended component for monitoring and diagnostics.

- **Details**:
 - It provides detailed telemetry data, including request rates, response times, and failure rates, helping you to understand how your functions are performing.
 - With Application Insights, you can set up alerts, visualize data through dashboards, and gain insights into the behavior and health of your serverless applications.
